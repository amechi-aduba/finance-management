# ***The PIGGYBNK Finance Management Website is a project created by Amechi Aduba and Isaac Tomeho with the main purpose of streamlining calculating your spending for an easier experience overall.***

## *As college students, we both understand the struggles that people have in managing their money and the task of making big financial decisions for oneself.*

### **The PIGGYBNK website has features such as:**

- A monetary tracker where the user inputs their payment amounts and savings by their bank or account name that will show graphs detailing one's spending.
- An interactive calendar where the user can highlight key events regarding their money, whether it is a payday, a tax day, or anything else.
- Lastly, an AI financial assistant that can guide the user to making the tough decisions. (NOT 100% ADVISED TO FOLLOW ALL DECISIONS)

This is currently a prototype and we are always open to add more features if needed.
